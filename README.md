# Video-Frame-Generation-Task

This project focuses on predicting the next frame in a sequence of video frames using a neural network, an essential task in video analysis with applications like video compression and anomaly detection. By leveraging a small dataset of sequential frames, the model learns temporal patterns to forecast visual information based on prior context. The workflow includes preprocessing the data for consistency, training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the next frame, and evaluating its performance through metrics and visual comparisons. It demonstrates a systematic approach to understanding sequence modeling and lays the groundwork for future advancements in computer vision tasks.
